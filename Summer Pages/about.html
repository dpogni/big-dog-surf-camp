                <h3>About The Big Dog</h3>
                <p>
                    Ian Glover aka The Big Dog was born and raised in Northern California. He started surfing at age 15
                    to keep up with his friends at Redwood High School. He became hooked on surfing instantly. It soon
                    drove every decision he made and eventually led him down to Santa Barbara where he entered every
                    surf contest he could get into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dreams of going pro came and went but his passion for the ocean never wavered. Ian started
                    teaching friends and family members to surf and really enjoyed it. He realized he could get just as
                    big of a stoke from showing someone else his love for the water as he got from actually surfing.
                    This led him into various summer camps over the past few years where he honed his technique for
                    teaching surfing up and down the coast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ian went to Dominican University to become a teacher and has been subbing at Ring Mountain
                    Elementary and Middle School for the past year. Teaching is as much of a passion for him as surfing
                    and being able to merge the two has been a dream come true.
                </p>
