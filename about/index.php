		<h3>About The Big Dog</h3>
		<p>
			Ian Glover aka The Big Dog was born and raised in Northern California. He started surfing at age 15 to keep up with his friends at Redwood High School. He became hooked on surfing instantly. It soon drove every decision he made and eventually led him around the world searching for the ultimate stoke.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ian started teaching friends and family members to surf and really enjoyed it. He realized he could get just as big of a stoke from showing someone else his love for the water as he got from actually surfing. This led him into various summer camps over the past few years where he honed his technique for teaching surfing up and down the coast.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ian went to Dominican University to become a teacher and has been subbing at Ring Mountain Elementary and Middle School for the past year. Teaching is as much of a passion for him as surfing and being able to merge the two has been a dream come true.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ian has run the surf camp for the past two years during the summers and gives individual lessons to people of every age and experience level. A compassionate and patient teacher, Ian is attuned to learners' ability, needs, fears and potential.	</p>
